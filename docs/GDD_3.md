# Cantus Crucis
_Army Management & Rhythm Strategy – Game Design Document_

## 1. Core Concept
Cantus Crucis is a medieval army management and real-time battle simulator where the player commands a crusading army through music. Orders are issued by performing melodies in a rhythm-based interface, and execution accuracy directly determines battlefield effectiveness.

## 2. Core Fantasy & Design Pillars
- **Music Is Command** — All battlefield orders are issued through melodies rather than direct control.
- **Skill Over Speed** — Timing, accuracy, and restraint matter more than raw input frequency.
- **Preparation Matters** — Army composition, stat investment, and melody selection define success.
- **Order vs Chaos** — Discipline and morale determine whether the army moves as one or falls apart.

## 3. Game Structure
- Preparation Phase: Strategic planning, upgrades, and training
- Battle Phase: Real-time rhythm-driven combat

## 4. Resources
### Gold
- Recruit new soldiers
- Purchase and upgrade equipment
- Pay dividends to restore or stabilize morale
- Gained from victories, quests, and enemy surrender
### Experience Points
- Tracked individually per soldier
- Used to upgrade soldier stats
- Earned through victories and enemy kills
- Stat upgrades scale in cost
### Ability Points
- Used to upgrade command melodies
- Used to progress the musical skill tree
- Earned by successfully playing melodies in battle

## 5. Unit Statistics
- Strength: Damage dealt; improved via weapons and XP
- Dexterity: Movement and attack speed; affected by armor, weapons, and mounts
- Endurance: Damage reduction; increased by heavier armor
- Obedience: Responsiveness to commands and buff effectiveness

## 6. Unit Classes / Jobs
### Squire
- No requirements
- Base unit
### Armsman
- Low Strength and Endurance required
- Bonus to melee weapons
### Infantry
- Low Dexterity and Endurance required
- Bonus to ranged weapons
### Knight
- High Strength and Obedience required
- Enhanced melee combat
- Can equip horses
### Crusader
- High Endurance and Obedience required
- Provides passive buffs to nearby allies
### Hospitaller
- High Endurance and Obedience required
- Heals nearby allies during battle

## 7. Preparation Phase (Expanded)
The Preparation Phase takes place in a base camp or nearby town between battles. This phase allows the player to plan, customize, and refine their army and command approach before engaging in combat.
### Strategic Management
- Equip the Army: Purchase weapons, armor, and gear using gold.
- Train Soldiers: Spend experience points to increase stats, change jobs/classes, and equip items.
- Develop Commands: Invest ability points into the musical skill tree to unlock or enhance melodies.
### World & Narrative Interaction
- NPC Interaction: Speak with townsfolk to receive quests, story context, or optional romance paths.
- These interactions are optional and exist primarily for narrative flavor and player enjoyment.
### Battle Arrangements
- Command Ordering: Reorder available command melodies for quick access during battle.
- Initial Deployment: Assign soldiers to flanks and define starting battle positions.
- Song Practice: Freely practice melodies with no effect on soldiers or morale.
- Gold Dividends: Distribute gold to soldiers to increase morale at the cost of currency.

## 8. Melody & Command System
Commands are executed by playing melodies using five fixed keys: 5, T, G, B, Space . Notes scroll from right to left toward a timing bar. Only one melody may be played at a time.
### Timing & Scoring
- Perfect (±3 frames): +5 points
- Good (±4–6 frames): +2 points
- Bad (±7–9 frames or wrong key): −2 points
- Miss: −3 points
The final melody score determines command strength. High scores grant buffs; low scores cause disorientation and temporary penalties.

## 9. Battle Phase
- Real-time combat
- Soldiers act autonomously
- Commands influence behavior and effectiveness
### Battle Screen Layout
- Left: Command list (selected melodies)
- Bottom: Rhythm input interface
- Center / Right: Battlefield

## 10. Morale System
- Single shared morale gauge
- Displayed as a large bar at the top of the battlefield
- Affected by success, casualties, and pressure
- Dedicated morale melody restores morale

## 11. Command Rules
- No cooldowns
- Commands must be replayed
- Interrupting a melody causes morale loss
- Silence is allowed without penalty

## 12. Enemy Behavior
- Enemies have obedience and coordination
- Act individually or as organized forces
- Do not interfere with rhythm mechanics
Enemy commanders may surrender. Accepting grants gold; rejecting grants experience.

## 13. Retreat & Failure
- Player may retreat at the cost of morale
- Partial experience retained
- Failure creates consequences, not resets

## 14. Difficulty Scaling
- Increased melody complexity
- Improved enemy coordination
- Higher tactical pressure

## 15. Accessibility & Training
- Clear visual timing markers
- Melody practice during preparation
- Colorblind-friendly design
